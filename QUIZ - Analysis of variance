1. Why would we use analysis of variance to compare groups, rather than multiple t-tests?

Correta - We retain statistical power.

2. You research the growth rates of plants with three different types of light source. You find that the between-group variance in plant growth greatly exceeds the within-group variance. What does this mean?

Correta - Each plant group may come from a different population distribution

3. Some of us need a little help to keep our energy levels up when we’re learning statistics. You run an experiment where you give people energy drinks, and see how many statistics chapters they complete. The table below shows the number of statistical tests people learned after drinking energy drinks. One group drank a can of ‘Blue Cow’, one group drank a can of ‘Popstar’ and one drank a can of ‘Demon’.
Calculate the within-group variance for your data.

Vector containing the amount of money you gave participants (predictor)
blue <- c(3, 5, 4, 7)
 
# Vector containing how much you smiled (predictor)
pop <- c(3, 6, 5, 8)
 
# Vector containing the amount the participants liked you (response)
demon <- c(2, 4, 5, 6)

model<-c(blue, pop, demon)

4. The table below shows the number of statistical tests people learned after drinking energy drinks.
Calculate the between-group variance for your data. The grand mean is 4.83.

5. A researcher was interested in how public spending affects public health. He compared health in 3 cities (high-, medium-, and low-spending), each with a sample of 10 people, hypothesizing that there would be a difference in health in the different groups. He found a within-group variance of 20.6, and a between-group variance of 36.5.

Use the given information to calculate the within and between degrees of freedom. Can the researcher reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level?

Correta - The researcher cannot reject the null hypothesis.

6. An aerobics instructor runs a few different classes, and is interested in which class motivates people the most. She asks 10 people in each of her three classes about their self-reported motivation and runs an ANOVA. She finds that her F-statistic is not significant. What is the most appropriate course of action following this?

Correta - Collect more data and rerun the study.


7. A pharmaceutical researcher runs a study comparing 4 kinds of painkillers. She finds a significant F statistic in a one-way ANOVA at her alpha level of 0.05. How many post-hoc tests must she run, and what alpha level will she use if she applies a Bonferroni correction?

Correta - 6 tests, 0.008

8. A vegetable shop owner was having trouble selling tomatoes, so he went to a sales convention where vegetable shop owners could discuss their favourite strategies. Five said that placing tomatoes at the window was best, five said near the cash desk, and five said outside. To figure this out once and for all, he gathered data of tomato sales from all 15 of these vegetable shop owners, and conducted a one-way ANOVA comparing mean tomato sales for different locations. The table below shows mean tomato sales for each location. The within-group sum of squares is 102
Calculate the upper 95% confidence interval boundary for the difference between the cash desk location, and outside location (in your calculation use: cash desk - outside). Use an alpha level of 0.05.
n<-15
sw<-102



9. The table below shows mean tomato sales for each location. The within-group sum of squares was 102. Calculate the lower 95% confidence interval boundary for the difference between the cash desk location, and outside location (in your calculation use: cash desk - outside). Use an alpha level of 0.05.

10. A biologist is looking at the effects of two different pesticides on growth of plants with three insect pests. What kind of design would she use?

Correta - 2 x 3 factorial design.

11. A biologist is looking at the effects of two different pesticides on growth of plants with three different insect pests. She wants to know which chemical is useful for destroying which insect. Which of the following effects would she be most interested in?

Correta - Interaction between chemical and insect.

12. A biologist is looking at the effects of two different pesticides on growth of plants with three different insect pests. She wants to know which chemical is useful for destroying which insect pest. What is the alternative hypothesis for the interaction effect?

Correta - The difference between mean growth with each pesticide will be different for at least one insect pest group

13. A market researcher is interested in coffee sales in students compared to non-students, and in men compared to women. She performs a 2x2 factorial ANOVA, with student status and gender as factors. The variance in women’s coffee sales is 23.56, whereas the variance in men’s coffee sales is 14.32. Can we go ahead with the ANOVA?

Correta - Yes, provided that all other assumptions are met.

14. A market researcher is interested in coffee sales in students compared to non-students, and in men compared to women. She performs a 2x2 factorial ANOVA, with student status and gender as factors. She finds a gender main effect F value of 3.2 with 1 and 65 degrees of freedom, and an F value of 5.6 for the interaction between gender with student status with 1 and 56 degrees of freedom. Based on the table below, what would we conclude?

Correta - The interaction between gender and student status is significant, but the main effect of gender is not significant.

15. A pet shop owner knows that cuteness is often an important factor in choosing a pet, but doesn’t think it’s very important when people buy reptiles. To test it, he performs an ANOVA on popularity of 24 reptiles, split equally into the categories “very cute”, “medium cute” and “not cute”. Although he performs an ANOVA, how would this look as a regression model?

popularity = intercept + b_{verycute}b verycuteX_{verycute}X verycute+ b_{mediumcute}b mediumcuteX_{mediumcute}X mediumcute	

16.The pet shop decides to run their analysis as a regression, and finds an error mean sum of squares of 6.8, and an F-statistic of 6.2.

What is the between-group variance?
