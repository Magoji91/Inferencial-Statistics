1. You want to develop a scary monster to star in a horror film. You’re pretty sure that blood and teeth make the monster more scary, whereas cuteness makes the monster less scary. You want to put this to the test with a linear regression model. Which of the following formulas would be appropriate?

R. Scariness = a + 1.6*(blood) + 2.8*(teeth) - 3.2*(cuteness)

2. Your friend says that your scary monster model is useless, and the only thing that makes a difference to scariness is whether the monster has a weapon.

What could you show your friend to prove that your model is useful?

R. The model’s R-squared.
