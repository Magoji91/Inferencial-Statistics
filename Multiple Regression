1. You want to develop a scary monster to star in a horror film. You’re pretty sure that blood and teeth make the monster more scary, whereas cuteness makes the monster less scary. You want to put this to the test with a linear regression model. Which of the following formulas would be appropriate?

R. Scariness = a + 1.6*(blood) + 2.8*(teeth) - 3.2*(cuteness)

2. Your friend says that your scary monster model is useless, and the only thing that makes a difference to scariness is whether the monster has a weapon.

What could you show your friend to prove that your model is useful?

R. The model’s R-squared.

Calculate the total sum of squares for the table below.

# Vector containing the amount of money you gave participants (predictor)
money  <- c(2.88, 3.22, 3.56, 3.9, 4.24)

# Vector containing the amount the participants liked you (response)
liking <- c(3.8, 2, 4, 3, 5)

# Find the regression coefficients for liking, predicted by smile and money
lm(liking~money)

# Assign the summary of lm(liking ~ smile) to 'mod1'
mod1 <- summary(lm(liking ~ money))

# Print the R-squared of 'mod1'
mod1$r.squared

# Sum and square the residuals from lm(liking ~ money), assign to object 'ssr'
ssr <- sum((lm(liking~money)$residual) ^ 2)

# Sum and square the value of mean liking - observed liking, assign to object 'sst'
sst <- sum((mean(liking) - liking) ^ 2)

# Find the R squared as (sst - ssr)/sst
(sst - ssr) / sst

# Find the regression mean square
rms <- (sst - ssr) / 2
  
# Find the mean squared error
mse <- (ssr) / 7
  
# Use rms and mse to find the F statsitic
rms / mse

# Fited model
mod <- lm(liking ~ money)

# Find confidence interval of fitted model
confint(mod, level = 0.9)

# Assign regression model to object "mod"
mod <- lm(liking ~ money)

# Obtain the residuals from mod using $, assign to "resmod"
resmod <- mod$residuals

# Plot the 'smile' on the x-axis, with the residuals on the y-axis
plot(smile, resmod)

# Plot the 'money' on the x-axis, with the residuals on the y-axis
plot(money, resmod)

# Assign regression model to object "mod"
mod <- lm(liking ~ money)

# Obtain the residuals from mod using $, assign to "resmod"
resmod <- mod$residuals

# Print the standardized residuals
resmod / sd(resmod)

6.Based on the total sum of squares and regression sum of squares, what can we say about our model of monster scariness?

R . Blood, teeth and cuteness can account for less than half of the variation in monster scariness.

7. Sometimes it’s scary to ask people out on dates, and sometimes it’s easier. A dating researcher decides to try to build a model to predict how likely a person is to ask someone on a date based on the following predictors: level of attraction, amount of loneliness, desperation, fear of rejection.

How many parameters are in the model? 3

8. After 20 observations, the model predicting how likely a person is to ask someone on a date based on level of attraction, amount of loneliness, desperation and fear of rejection has an error sum of squares of 10.6 and a total sum of squares of 26.2.

What is the F-test statistic?
