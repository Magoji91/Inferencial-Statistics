3. A teacher is interested in whether university students are more enthusiastic about learning after drinking one beer. To test this, they ask a sample of students how enthusiastic they are about learning before and after drinking a beer. Their enthusiasm levels are shown below:
x<-c(2,3,2,4,3)
y<-c(3,2,1,2,3)
ct<-cbind(x,y)
chifit<-chisq.test(ct)
chifit
(chifit$residuals)^2
ct2<-ct[-4,]
chisq.test(ct2)
wilcox.test(x,y, exact=TRUE)
rank.test(x,y)
wilcox.test(y,x,conf.int=TRUE)
rank.test(x,y,scores=nscores)
rank.test(x,y,scores=nscores,conf.int=TRUE)
