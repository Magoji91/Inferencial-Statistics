1. Which kind of tests are less versatile?
Non-parametric

2. A researcher is investigating how smart the dogs at a dog beauty pageant are alongside another variable. Which of the following variables could not be tested using parametric means and therefore requires a non-parametric test?
The order of runners up.

3. A teacher is interested in whether university students are more enthusiastic about learning after drinking one beer. To test this, they ask a sample of students how enthusiastic they are about learning before and after drinking a beer. Their enthusiasm levels are shown below:
x<-c(2,3,2,4,3)
y<-c(3,2,1,2,3)
ct<-cbind(x,y)
chifit<-chisq.test(ct)
chifit
(chifit$residuals)^2
ct2<-ct[-4,]
chisq.test(ct2)
wilcox.test(x,y, exact=TRUE)
rank.test(x,y)
wilcox.test(y,x,conf.int=TRUE)
rank.test(x,y,scores=nscores)
rank.test(x,y,scores=nscores,conf.int=TRUE)


9. A cat lover has 18 cats, from four different breeds. He is interested in whether one breed is significantly larger than the others and runs a Kruskal-Wallis test to check this.

At least one breed of cat does not have a significantly different size.

10. Under what circumstance would the cat lover be able to use a one-way ANOVA instead of a Kruskal-Wallis?
If the distribution in each group was skewed.

11. Which of the plots below would we label as linear, and which would we label as monotonic?
Plot 3 is monotonic, plot 2 is linear.

13. What can we conclude about study hours and grades based on the obtained Spearman correlation coefficient?
There is a weak negative relationship between study hours and grades.

15.Can we reject the null hypothesis that the order of animals at the cat and dog parade was random?
YES
